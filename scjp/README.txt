A single feature of the SCJP exam that makes it difficult is that it is very code intensive.
In order to succeed in the exam, you must develop stamina for reading and understanding code.
To raise your comfort level with the code, this book offers complete code examples that you
can compile, execute, and experiment with.

This code is organized into the following directory structure:
  scjp\code\<parts>
<parts> stands for the following three folders:
1. chapters. This folder contains subfloders for all chapters named as chap1, chap2, and so on.
             Each subfolder consists of source code files (*.java) for the code listings 
             in the chapter. Some examples may be designed to generate error. So, it's 
             important that you read about the code listing in the chapter of the book before
             trying the code.

2. exam. This folder consists of subfolders corresponding to the exma questions. Again,
         some examples may be designed to generate error. So, it's important that you read
         the question in the Practice Exam in the book before trying the code example.

3. test   This folder contains the source code example forAppendix A in the book.

 
4. extra. These source code files are as exercises. Try them and figure out their behavior.
To maximize learning, do the following:
             A. Compile and execute the code in the context of the corresponding discussion 
                in the book. 
             B. Experiment with the code.
